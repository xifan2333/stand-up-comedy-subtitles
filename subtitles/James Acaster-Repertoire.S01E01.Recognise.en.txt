[electronic music plays]

[cheering and applause]

Thank you.

[music and applause stops]

[scattered laughter]

-Yeah.
-[laughter]

How's it going at the back?

[audience]
Yeah!

Strong.

What a good back section.
Best seats in the house, the back...

at a comedy show.

-Safe.
-[laughter]

You're so safe, you got your feet up,
"No one's talking to us."

I come out, "How's it going at the back?"

"What?

[laughter]

Belittle the life choices
of the front row, please."

[laughter]

I'm not gonna belittle any
of your life choices.

Don't even worry about it.
Not 'cause I'm nice, by the way.

'Cause I've been in this game
long enough to know that the front row

are no longer the easy targets
they once were.

They're now a bunch of prepped
attention-seekers...

[laughter]

praying that I pick them so they can
destroy me in front of my new friends.

-Forget about it. It's not gonna happen.
-[laughter]

You got a hoodie on, mate.
I know a trap when I see one.

[laughter]

Wearing his hoodie, hoping
he'll lure me in with the bait.

I ask him why he's got his hoodie on,

he hits me with some
hoodie-based one-liners

he workshopped with his stupid friends.
In your sweet dreams.

You should be ashamed of yourself.
The gig's not about you.

[laughter]

Check your ego at the door.

[laughter]

It's about me, start to finish,
the whole show.

And what a life.

Recently moved next door
to a Mexican restaurant,

that's the headlines.

I don't mind it. I like it.

Here's what you need to know
about the restaurant,

everyone steals their spoons.

They've got beautiful spoons.
Everyone nicks them,

so much so that every January,
they've got to have a spoon amnesty on.

If you've stolen a spoon from there,
if you bring it back in January,

they reward you with free tacos.

[laughter]

Genius.

Not only do they get their spoons back,

they also get to watch
while the thieves eat tacos

which I imagine have been
interfered with beyond belief.

[laughter]

What you got a hoodie on for?

[laughter]

It's cold outside?

It's...

[laughter]

He is firing on all cylinders.

[laughter]

I knew he would be. I walked into that.
I deserved every bit of what I got.

Uh, one-nil to you. Hope you're happy.

[scattered laughter]

I don't steal the spoons, by the way.
Just so you know.

I'm not-- I'm not a rule-breaker.

I like to find loopholes.
That's different, isn't it? That's fun.

More satisfying, finding a loophole.

Everyone's favorite loophole?
Infinite wishes.

[laughter]

Yeah, you like infinite wishes, don't you?

You find a lamp, you rub it, a genie
comes out, grants you three wishes,

what's your first wish?

Infinite wishes. Clever.

That is a clever loophole for a situation,

let's face it, none of us
are ever gonna end up in ever.

[laughter]

We showed those genies, am I right?
Stupid genies.

Some people don't like infinite wishes.

You say "infinite wishes" to them,
they're like, "No! No way! Not allowed.

You can't say 'infinite wishes,'
it's against the rules."

I'm always like, "Yo, you know what, man?
Fair enough. Fair play.

That wasn't the information
you were after, I'm wasting your time.

I apologize.
I won't say 'infinite wishes' again."

"You better not say
'infinite wishes' again."

"I won't." "Good. What's your first wish?"

"Infinite genies."

[laughter]

Infinite genies is the best wish.
Not only do I get infinite wishes,

also takes care of my second wish:
more friends.

[laughter]

I love to hang out with genies
all the time.

Did you see Aladdin? He stole the show.

[laughter]

I love finding loopholes.
I find them all the time.

Like in stupid London where I stupid live,
on the underground,

the escalators enforce the rule:
stand on the right, walk on the left.

I loophole that every day.

What they've overlooked is the fact that
left and right are relative concepts

depending on what way you're facing.

[laughter]

Stand on my right and try and guess

where the escalators end,
thank you very much.

[scattered laughter]

Sometimes you get a couple
standing on the right of the escalator.

They're facing each other,
just smooching all the way down.

I like to intervene and be like,

"Excuse me, but strictly speaking,
one of you should be on the move."

[laughter]

I love those escalators.
All the way down on the walls,

there's posters for all the different
West End shows that are on.

It's exciting.

When I was a little boy, my dad told me
the people who put up those posters

have one of the hardest jobs in the world.

[laughter]

To this day, I admire their agility.

[laughter]

One of my favorite loopholes,
of all time, actually,

was discovered by Torvill and Dean,
of all people.

The 1984 Olympics, cast your minds back,

performing their world famous
Boléro routine for the very first time.

Now, the song they were gonna skate to
lasted four minutes, 28 seconds,

but Olympic rules stated

the performance was only allowed
to last four minutes, ten seconds.

There's another rule.

Said the stopwatch only officially started

when their ice skates touched the ice.

They found a loophole.

For the first 18 seconds of that song,
they performed it kneeling down.

And when you love loopholes
as much as I do...

[laughter]

and you discover that a couple of,
and I'm not gonna mince my words,

dweeby little squares
like Torvill and Dean

have found such a good one,
you get real jealous real quick.

I thought I'm not gonna sulk about it.

Not only am I gonna find a loophole,
I'm gonna find the exact same loophole.

And it feels great.
Here I am, I'm kneeling down,

we haven't officially started yet,
none of this counts.

[laughter]

[applause]

None of this counts.
If someone walks in now,

if anything they're early.

[laughter]

If anyone heckles, it is personal.

[laughter]

Earlier, when you said that thing
about being cold,

if I was standing up,
that could have derailed the whole show.

As it is, I'm kneeling down,

I can wait until I'm standing up
to give him both barrels.

-And I will give you both barrels.
-[laughter]

I hope you like getting
both barrels, mate.

[scattered laughter]

The show properly starts
with a routine about childhood,

but, um, full disclosure,
that is a long ways down the way.

[laughter]

In the meantime,
I'm gonna tell you a story.

You need to know two things about me
going into this story:

I bear a lot of grudges,
and I love French cuisine.

[laughter]

I love French cuisine.
That's why this story takes place

in a Pret A Manger.

[laughter]

Ah, have you been there? Mamma mia. Ah.

-[laughter]
-Ah.

I love manger-ing there.

There's so much good stuff to manger.

I love to manger in Pret A Manger.

I think my favorite thing
to manger there is the yogurts.

I love to manger the yogurts.

It's like-- They're in a pot,
and it's like--

It's like granola on top,
then mainly yogurt,

then fruit compote at the bottom.

-You know, the way they eat it in Paris.
-[laughter]

And, uh, you get a spoon,
and you mix it all together,

then you manger it that way,
if you like.

I don't actually mix it.
I just leave it as it is,

and I work my way down in order.

I start off with nothing but granola,

just shoving raw granola into my mouth,

deflecting off my teeth this way and that.

And then I power through the yogurt
for a really long time,

getting precious little out of it,
if I'm honest.

It's a real trudge. You know what I mean?
I don't like the yogurt part.

And then I end on the tangy compote,

like, "Whoa, what a finale!
Oh, my God! All the flavor at once. Ah."

That's how I eat yogurt.
I eat them like they're packaged.

That's why I like them Fruit Corners.
They come with that little chaser.

[laughter]

I went in Pret A Manger one day,

all I wanted was a banana.
That's all I wanted to manger.

I went in there--
Doesn't ever get less funny, that.

[laughter]

Every time I say it, it's still funny.

[scattered laughter]

Got a banana, put it on the counter,

I said, "Just that, s'il vous plaît."

-[laughter]
-Make the effort.

Make the effort in Pret A Manger.

I make the effort, you should.

"Just that, s'il vous plaît."

The lady behind the counter,

she goes, "Oh! Oh, we're giving away
free bananas today."

"Thanks very much."

Picked up the banana,
I turned to leave,

she goes,

"Hold on a second.
Where are you going?

I said we're giving away free bananas.

I didn't say all of the bananas are free."

[scattered laughter]

How unnecessary.

I don't know what I've done
to offend this woman in the past,

but she's laid
a language loophole for me,

and I've fallen for it
hook, line and sinker.

I wasn't gonna rise to it, though.
Stayed very calm.

I said, "Oh, I'm sorry.

Which of the bananas...

[laughter]

are free?"

As soon as I asked her,
I think it highlighted

how insane it would have been
if that had been my initial response.

If someone says to you...

[laughter]

"We're giving away free bananas today,"

and without question you go,
"Which specific ones?

[laughter]

Looking at this box of bananas,
I want to know which individual ones

the offer applies to.

It can't be all of them.
We're not living in a fantasy land.

This isn't my dreams."

"Which bananas are free?"

Her eyes lit up. She couldn't wait
to tell me which bananas were free.

She goes, "These ones."

And she pointed at this pile
of jet black bananas,

just black as the night sky.

Wobbling as well,
there was no solids in those skins,

just a pile on the counter,

and I don't want to manger
no dead banana.

[laughter]

Look, I know you can't tell
what a banana's like

on the outside based on the inside.

I know that. I'm an adult.

But some bananas, ugly on the outside,
beautiful on the inside.

Other bananas, beautiful on the outside,
ugly on the inside.

It's evolution's way
of making sure shallow people

don't get enough potassium
in their bodies.

And rightfully so. Deserve everything
they get, shallow people.

If there's any shallow people
in tonight, get out.

[laughter]

None of them are welcome.

Be that as it may,

I turned down the offer and I paid
full price for my yellow banana.

As I'm handing her the money,

she does this face at me--
Clearly what she wanted to do

was look at someone and roll her eyes

at the guy paying full price
for the banana.

But no one else was around,
so she kind of looked at me and went,

"I know, that's the guy."

[laughter]

I'm almost at the door, nearly home free,
hand on the handle,

and I hear her mutter to herself--

And this still boils my blood
to this day, actually.

Under her breath, she goes,

[muttering]

"He thinks he's too good
for a free banana."

-Never before...
-[laughter]

have I been so offended

by something I 100 percent agree with.

[laughter]

Yeah, I am too good
for a free banana, actually.

We all are, aren't we?

If you're sitting there thinking,
"Oh, I'm not,"

believe in yourself a little bit.

It is a banana. It is a banana.

You've never been standing there
holding a banana

and someone's come up to you and gone,

"Ooh-hoo, you're punching
above your weight, aren't you?"

-It's never happened.
-[laughter]

It's lucky to have you if anything,
that banana.

Couldn't get it out of my head.

Days, weeks, months went by,
I was still furious about it.

Went past Pret A Manger nine months later,

looked in the window,
the bananas were gone at this point.

Frankly, I was surprised.

I half expected them to have been
decanted into a paddling pool

with a sign stuck in them
that said "free smoothies"

so people could drag their cups
through the mush and leave.

"Oh, Pret A Manger, your generosity
continues to astound us. Ah..."

The bananas were gone,
but my nemesis was not.

[scattered laughter]

She was standing behind the counter,
handing someone a Danish like a prick.

[laughter]

Like a prick.

I was furious, still angry.
I knew I had to get revenge.

And I know exactly
how I'm gonna do it now.

Got it all planned out. Step one:
I'm gonna open my own banana shop...

[laughter]

in her neck of the woods.

And that's all we sell, is bananas.

Sooner or later, she's gonna go in.

'Cause let's face it,

if a shop opens up
in your neck of the woods

that only sells bananas and nothing else,

you're gonna go in at some point
just to see.

Does it really just sell bananas?

[laughter]

Once you're in the shop
that only sells bananas,

you've got to buy a banana.

'Cause only a maniac would go
in the shop that only sells bananas

and go, "I'm sorry, you haven't got
what I'm looking for,"

-and then leave.
-[laughter]

I've got her where I want her now.

She'll come in, pick up a banana,
put it on the counter,

she'll go, "Just that, please."

And I'll go...

"Oh.

Oh, hey, we're giving away
free bananas today."

[scattered laughter]

She'll go...

"Oh, which ones are fr--?"

'Cause let's face it, I'm not gonna
trip her up at this hurdle, am I?

-[laughter]
-She invented this trick.

"Which ones are free?"

And I'll say...

"All of them.

[scattered laughter]

All of the bananas are free."

And against her better instincts,
she'll pick up a banana,

and say, "Thanks very much."

She'll turn to leave,

and just as I'm out of her peripheral,
soon as I get out of her peripheral,

I'll go, "Hold on a second.

Where are you going?

[laughter]

I said all the bananas are free,

I didn't say all of the bananas
are free to everybody."

[laughter]

And she'll be all angry.
She'll go, "Who are they free to, then?"

And then, here's the kicker,
I'll go, "Me,"

-and then I eat all the bananas.
-[laughter]

Just doing laps of the banana shop,
just hoofing them into my mouth,

making disturbing noises as well.

I haven't worked on them yet,

but I'm gonna work on it
and get some disturbing noises going.

And then she'll be all flustered,

she'll be like, "Who are you?
Why are you doing this?"

And I'll be-- I've taken off my disguise.
I was wearing a disguise all along.

-[laughter]
-And I'll go,

"It's me. Boo! Who's too good for--?

[watch beeps]

-Who's too good for a free banana now?
-[laughter]

-I'm too good for a free banana.
-[applause]

Always have been, always will.

Always will be too good
for a free banana."

Yes! Cold like a wanker.

Boom, dealt with!
Dealt with, both barrels.

Both barrels. I did it.

[scattered laughter]

So, childhood's a funny thing.

[laughter]

It's stressful as a child, I think.

It's a lot on you.

People ask you what you want to be
when you grow up all the time.

Coming up to you, adults,

"What do you want to be when you grow up?"

"I don't know. Secure enough in myself

I'm not putting this kind of pressure
on six-year-olds. How does that sound?

[laughter]

This how you get your kicks, mate?

See you later, sicko.
Go back to hanging out with my dad.

I never wanted to talk to you
in the first place."

I knew exactly what I wanted to be
when I was a kid, when I grew up.

I wanted to be a undercover cop.

But I didn't tell no one.

[scattered laughter]

Kept it secret.

'Cause then when I grow up,
become an undercover cop,

first day on the job,
already blown my cover...

running my mouth off
all round town as a child.

[laughter]

So I was smart.
Whenever an adult asked me,

"What do you want to be when you grow up?"

I thought long-term,
I said, "Drug dealer."

[laughter]

Every time.

Then if you grow up,
become an undercover cop,

infiltrate a gang of drug dealers,

if any of them get suspicious, like,

"Hey, you think James
might be an undercover cop?"

the others will be like, "No way.

This is his lifelong dream.

[laughter]

Don't you ever say that again."

[laughter]

It paid off. I'm now an adult.
I'm a fully-fledged undercover cop.

Why am I doing stand-up? I'll tell you.

[laughter]

Ten years ago, I had to infiltrate a gang

dealing drugs to comedians
backstage at comedy gigs.

Naturally, I assumed the identity
of a stand-up comedian

to get close to the gang.

Ten years down the line,
still haven't closed the case,

but the gigs keep rolling in.
Good to be here.

[laughter]

Needless to say, the boys at Scotland Yard

don't much appreciate me
telling you all this shit.

I get in trouble all the time.

The captain called me
into his office the other day.

"Springleaf! Get--"
Um, that's my real name.

[laughter]

Uh, Pat Springleaf.

[laughter]

"Springleaf, get in here.

What's this I hear about you
talking about the case on stage?

You total idiot."

"Captain, it's not my fault.
You keep booking me all these gigs,

filling my diary all the time.

I'm having to write new material.

Of course I'm talking about
my real life now.

I'm running out of ideas.

If you don't like it,
stop booking me so many gigs."

He's like, "Uh, you're forgetting

I'm currently undercover
as a comedy booker right now.

[laughter]

I have to book these gigs,
or it looks suspicious."

He's the worst booker ever.
Got me this shit.

[laughter]

Got me that gig in Crawley

where the man threw Maltesers at me
and called me a bitch.

[laughter]

Got me that gig in a members-only club.

The worst gig he ever got me
was in a members-only club.

Twenty of the most entitled people
I've ever met in my life.

Treated me like their own personal
court jester for the whole show,

just heckling me
and knocking back calamari shavings.

It was awful.

I weren't even getting paid money.

My payment: membership to the club.

At one point,
I started bantering with them,

asked them what they did for a living.

Turns out, they were all
stand-up comedians

who'd done the gig in the past.

[laughter]

I got over it two weeks later,

had a mouthful of olives, heckling
Josh Widdicombe like a champion.

[laughter]

No regrets.

I love being an undercover cop.
I love it.

Purest form of copping there is.
Just pure copping.

Pure copping. Don't even wear a uniform.

Every day is mufti day, imagine that.

[laughter]

Just me and my mufti.

And a gun. I got a gun on my ankle.

That's it, just pure copping.

It's me, my mufti, and my gun.

And a wire. I wear a wire at all times,

recording what's going on around me,
but that is it.

Just pure copping.

It's me, my mufti, my gun, and my wire.

And a magnifying glass
for looking at clues.

[laughter]

[scattered applause]

Let you into a secret,

I originally did that bit with a gun.
Didn't go as well.

[laughter]

Went bad.

I'm currently infiltrating
this gang of drug dealers.

I'm in the gang, and I'm blending in

like a roast parsnip
in a bowl of roast potatoes.

So, so smooth.

[laughter]

No problemo.

Oh, I should explain actually. Um...

Uh, "no problemo," that is a gangster term.

It means "I can perform the task
assigned to me without any difficulty."

[laughter]

You've got to talk gangster
when you hang out with gangsters.

Once, I nearly gave myself away
by saying "flabbergasted."

[laughter]

Luckily I managed to convince them
it was a homophobic slur.

[laughter]

They misuse it a lot.

[laughter]

I actually quite get on with the gang.
I like them.

We've had our arguments,
sometimes with Lawrence, you know.

Lawrence is the leader of the gang,
to be fair, and that's not fun.

Leadership looks fun, but it's stressful.

It's like if you ever see anyone
leading a conga.

[scattered laughter]

Oh, on the outside,
they're loving it, sure.

The whole time...

[scattered laughter]

"Put your drink down."
Yes, you bloody are, mate. Come on."

-[laughter]
-Ah-ha!

In their heads just...

"I don't know where I'm going.

[laughter]

Ah, I didn't plan a route.

I never asked for any of this.

God, I miss my family."

[laughter]

[Acaster panting]

Everyone's trapped...

in the conga.

[laughter]

Oh, what, you think you can leave?
You can't leave.

Person at the back maybe.
They can let go, make a run for it.

Everyone else, you let go,
you're not out the conga.

Now you're the leader of a rival conga.

[laughter]

Now you've got turf wars to worry about.

Worst-case scenario,
you're second from the back, you let go,

the one person behind you loves congas,
isn't giving up for anyone.

Now you're trying to mingle at the party
with a maniac on your hips.

A lone madman. You want to have
a discussion about Brexit,

they're still going hell for leather.

[laughter]

You'd have to go swimming
just to get rid of him.

[laughter]

The argument we had recently,
me and Lawrence,

was about oven gloves. Ridiculous.

You know when you buy oven gloves
you've got two options?

I like to buy the two individual
separate oven gloves personally.

You know, one for each hand.
They're independent of each other.

And you're free...

as you always imagined you would be
as an adult in your own kitchen...

to move as you please.

He gets these oven gloves where

you've still got another glove
for each hand,

but they're joined together
by that filthy hammock.

[laughter]

Most bacteria in a bit of fabric
in your entire house.

It's a quilted germ blanket.

Oh, what you handling with that?

Please let it be food.

Please say it's food
you're picking up with a germ cloth.

Can't wait to manger
whatever it is you're cooking.

[laughter]

That's your full range
of movement with them.

What if someone attacks you?
You can't defend yourself.

It could happen. Just 'cause
you're getting something out of the oven,

doesn't mean the whole world stands still.

What are you gonna do, garrote them?

Hope in a week's time
they get a fungal infection?

[laughter]

They do not need to be joined together.

No one's threading those oven gloves
through the sleeves of their jacket

like a pair of winter mittens
to my knowledge.

Lawrence goes, "They need to be
joined together, James,

so they don't get separated,
thank you very much."

They're oven gloves.

They are oven gloves.

Correct me if I'm wrong,
they are not leaving the kitchen.

Neither one of them
is leaving the kitchen, are they?

There's an oven glove in the kitchen.
Where's the other one?

Probably in the kitchen.

[laughter]

Probably somewhere in the kitchen.

No one's leaving one oven glove
by the stove,

then hitting the town solo-gloving it...

[laughter]

like a culinary Michael Jackson,
going up to people.

You don't take that risk.

I said to him,
"Man, do yourself a favor.

Take that onesie oven glove
back to the shop.

Buy yourself some proper oven gloves."

This is what he says, he goes...

"Ah. Oven gloves, schmoven gloves."

[scattered laughter]

That's how he argues.

-And he won, by the way.
-[laughter]

Oven gloves, schmov--

Won every argument we've ever had
with that technique.

Oven gloves, schmoven gloves.
Bowling, schmowling.

Cinema, schminema.

[laughter]

The only argument he didn't win with that

was one time when we argued
about schmoozing.

[laughter]

If it begins with "schm,"
he ain't got nothing.

Believe you me, when you're leaving
the house off to do a bit of schmoozing,

and he's shouting
"schmoozing, schmoozing" after you,

it's more encouraging than dismissive.

[laughter]

Put a spring in my step.

Actually really good at schmoozing.

I thought I'd use
this opportunity in the show

to give you some schmoozing tips.

You look like some happening cats.

Maybe you're gonna schmooze
someone at an office do.

Now, a lot of people tell you

when you're schmoozing,
have a good icebreaker.

At the top of the conversation,
break the ice.

What they won't tell you,

at the end of the conversation,
unbreak the ice. Right?

You don't want anyone else sweeping in,

taking advantage of all the lovely
little ice cubes that you created.

So freeze it over again before you leave.

[laughter]

Just as you're leaving,
just slide something under the fence,

like "death comes to us all,"
something like that.

[laughter]

Set the tone for the rest of the evening.

Good luck anyone else
penetrating that fortress.

Nod a lot. When they're talking,
you do a lot of nodding.

That lets them know that
you're listening.

Every now and again,
just throw in something like,

"Wow, I don't normally nod this much."

-Make them feel special.
-[laughter]

"I'm gonna have to bill you
for my next neck massage.

You got me nodding
like a damn fool over here.

Anyway, I'll see you in the office.

There's only 3000 tigers
left in the wild.

[laughter]

They're on the verge
of extinction, Jerry."

I love schmoozing, man.

Gets me out of the house,
meet new people.

Maybe meet a lady. Why not?
I am single.

My goddamn wife left me

'cause I was getting too obsessed
with the case.

[laughter]

I miss her.

So what? I'm not made of stone.

I'm not gonna act tough
in front of you guys.

Of course I miss her.

You don't realize how much you need
something till it's gone, do you?

Like your fingernails.

[laughter]

You don't realize how much
you need your fingernails

until you cut your fingernails.

Then that's the day you've got to go
and put four new keys on a key ring.

[laughter]

It's agony. It's not worth it.

Have them loose in your pocket
and guess. Live your life.

[laughter]

She left me on...
On National Fondue Day.

[scattered laughter]

Of all days.

[laughter]

I only knew it was National Fondue Day

'cause I went to Google
"one-bedroom flats"

and the Google logo, it was all made up
of fondue-related imagery.

[laughter]

The capital G was a wheel of cheese,

had a bit cut out of it.
It was a dead ringer for a G.

The two Os were like aerial shots
of pots of fondue.

They were bubbling away.
Animated, that was a nice touch.

The lowercase G was a guy,
he was just sitting there.

He was just eating fondue,

but not even in the shape of a G--
Actually, let's address this.

Sometimes, Google don't even try
with some of the letters.

[laughter]

Thank you very much.
Speaking for the people at this gig.

[laughter]

He wasn't there in a G shape like that,
he was just sitting there like, eh.

"I think you're fully aware
what I represent, mate.

I'm next to both the Os.
You figure it out, genius.

You came on google.com.
What do you think it says?"

And we accept it.
We just accept it every time.

They can put anything
above that search bar.

It can say "Yahoo," and we'll all go,

"That says 'Google.' Nicely done.

Very subversive today, Google."

I'm living on my own now.

Miss her.

Started drinking on my own. Who cares?

No, I quite like it actually.

Every night, I lock the door to my flat,
get myself a glass of punch.

Is that weird? I drink punch on my own.

-Is that strange?
-[laughter]

I drink it in front of a big punch bowl
with a ladle in it,

in the corner of my bedroom.

Is that--? I don't know
what other people do.

People are always worried
about punch getting spiked.

Solo punch, problem solved.

[laughter]

I'm not gonna spike myself
unless it's Fun Time Thursdays.

[laughter]

I don't get hammered on my own.

I don't get trashed, I just get tipsy.

Tipsy is the best thing
you can be in life, is tipsy.

There's four things you can be in life:

sober, tipsy, drunk, hungover.

Tipsy's the only one out of the four
where you don't cry during it.

[laughter]

I should've warned you earlier,
some of the jokes are sad.

[laughter]

Got to choose your soft drink
when you're getting tipsy.

Make sure every other drink
is a soft drink.

Sustain it, maintain it.

[scattered laughter]

I'm a Dr Pepper man. I love Dr Pepper.

I don't claim to understand it.
I'm not that arrogant, of course not.

[laughter]

What an enigma that drink is.

I drink it every night.
I could not tell you what flavor it is,

-hand on heart.
-[laughter]

No idea. If I had my mouth
full of Dr Pepper

with all my other senses shut off,

I'd be like, "It tastes like
a sexy battery. Are you happy?

-[laughter]
-It tastes like a sexy battery."

The can says "mixed fruit flavor."

Hm.

Uh, I weren't born yesterday.
I know what fruit tastes like!

-[laughter]
-I've had fruit before.

I've never sent a fruit salad back
'cause it was too Dr Peppery.

[laughter]

That's a lie, I have. It's really funny.

I send most food back
'cause it's too Dr Peppery

just to see how they bring it back
and what they change.

[laughter]

You learn a lot about a chef.

When she kicked me out,

I decided that
I'd throw myself into my work.

That's pretty common
after a breakup, right?

I thought I'd do a comedy podcast

about something that I'm passionate about.

Not a lot of people know this,
but, uh, I love mathematics.

Love mathematics.

Favorite number: umpteen.

[laughter]

It's a curious number, right?

It sounds big, but it's in the teens.

[laughter]

Someone's cooking the books.

[laughter]

Favorite mathematician, Pythagoras.

Whoa, yeah, of course.

Great mathematician,
great catchphrase as well.

We all loved his catchphrase, didn't we,
Pythagoras? You remember his catchphrase.

You remember his catchphrase, don't you?

He used to say it quite a lot.
Pretty popular.

He used to-- What would he say?
He'd go, "Hey!

Hey, every triangle is a love triangle
when you love triangles."

Do you remember that? That was great.

-[laughter]
-I loved it so much.

"Every triangle is a love triangle
when you love triangles."

A good catchphrase.

[scattered laughter]

Not my favorite theorem though,
controversially.

Hippasus. A lot of people
have heard of him.

Mathematician, dealt mainly with squares.

He discovered if you get any square,

you draw four carefully calculated lines
within that square,

uh, you end up with this...

[audience]
Ooh...

[scattered laughter]

which, as you're all clearly aware,

is the most satisfying way
you can close a cardboard box.

[laughter]

It feels so good.

No tape.

No string.

[laughter]

All box.

[laughter]

Admit it, the first time you saw
a cardboard box get closed like that,

your brain couldn't make sense of it.

"How is every flap the top flap?"

[scattered laughter]

I love closing boxes like that.

Hands down, best part of my divorce.

[laughter]

I'm there closing all the boxes,

the parcel tape's looking down
at me from the shelf.

I'm like, "Screw you,
you stupid parcel tape.

I don't need you anymore.

I'm closing the boxes
using the boxes themselves.

You can suck it. You can suck it forever,
you goddamn parcel tape--"

To be honest, I was taking the divorce
a lot harder than I thought I was.

[laughter]

I took a lot of it out on the parcel tape.

Obviously you don't land
on a theorem like that first time.

A lot of trial and error getting there.

We've all been here, haven't we?

Horrible. That is a horrible feeling.

[laughter]

I shouldn't have brought that up
during a comedy show actually.

That is bumming you out. I can feel it.

[laughter]

I can feel it ruining the buzz, you know?

You got excited, early doors,

you rushed, you didn't plan ahead,
and now look where you are.

When you're done, that happens with a box,
you're there, you're looking at it

and going, "I know what I should do.

Open all the flaps up
and start from square one.

I'm a sensible person."

However... having a look at it
from this angle,

I can see that really,
it's only this bit that is wrong.

These three bits are exactly
how I wanted them.

So, what I will do--

And this'll be clever actually.
This is a clever idea. Little timesaver.

I'm gonna lever this flap
over the top of this one

without touching any of this.

I'll just leave this locked in as it is.

And, man, you really discover
how strong a cardboard box is

when you try and pull that stunt.
It is strong.

You're arm wrestling with it.
Maybe you pull too hard,

you rip the side of the box.

The parcel tape's looking down at you
like, "Well, well, well.

[laughter]

Look who came crawling back."

"Shut up, you stupid parcel tape.
Suck it forever."

[scattered laughter]

My favorite mathematician, that guy.

It's a privilege of mine
doing a gig tonight of all nights,

'cause today is his birthday.

I know that 'cause my favorite website
told me so this morning.

I was very excited
when I got up and I saw this.

[applause]

Finally, credit where it is due.

In the end, I just decided
to do a normal comedy podcast

where they just sit around
talking to each other.

That's what most podcasts are.

And I'm doing that all day long anyway,
with the drug dealers,

just sitting around talking.

Plus, I'm already recording it.

[laughter]

Wearing the wire, man.

I had to make sure that
I steered the topic of conversation

towards more podcast-friendly subjects.

Like ask them fun hypothetical questions
and stuff like that.

Then all I had to do was write
a funky cool theme tune.

I downloaded a bunch of funny noises
off the Internet

that I could put in in post,
little sound effects and stuff.

Got a hit podcast on my hands.

And I'm gonna play it to you now.

This is my comedy podcast.

Just me and the drug dealers
just sitting around shooting the breeze.

Um, fair warning, they don't know
that they're being recorded, obviously.

Um, also, the podcast did come in
a little bit early,

but I filled the time by putting

what is indisputably the best song
in the world at the end,

so it's absolutely fine.

This is my comedy podcast.

It's called "The Wire."

[laughter]

[funky music plays]

[voice on recording]
The Wire.

[Acaster]
Morning, guys. Looking good.

Reg, Hughie, Mr. Mason.
My main man Lawrence.

-Where's Ted?
-[man] Ted's dead.

-He was the rat, James.
-[Acaster] No, he wasn't.

I shouldn't have said that.

[laughter]

I hold my hands up,
that was unprofessional.

The captain did not like that.
Next morning, called me into his office,

"Springleaf! Please tell me
that's not your voice...

[laughter]

claiming that somebody else
is not the rat.

And why are your wire recordings
available for public download?"

[laughter]

"It's called a podcast.

I'd get with the times.
I can't hold your hand every day."

[scattered laughter]

Speaking of which, back to it.

[Lawrence]
Stop messing around.

We've got some serious
business to discuss.

-Here we go.
-[Acaster] Too right.

Listen up, fellas.

If you could be half animal,
half human,

which animal would you be,
and which half would you choose?

[Lawrence]
Animal, schmanimal.

End of that game. What's the point?

[laughter]

Excuse me for trying to make
the meetings more fun.

Another thing that they do
in comedy podcasts,

a lot of the time
they'll make fun of each other.

'Cause everyone loves that.

It's kind of like bullying.
Remember how funny that was in school?

-[laughter]
-So...

Hughie doesn't like
being called a caveman,

so I thought, "Let the ribbing commence."

[Lawrence]
Now this shipment comes in on Friday.

That's only five more sleeps.

If the police find out,

then we're all going down
for a long, long time.

[Acaster] Did you understand that, Hughie,
you bloody caveman?

-[Hughie] I've had enough of this.
-[gun cocks]

Call me a caveman again, you wanker...

[Lawrence]
Put your gun away.

[Acaster]
Snog, marry, avoid. Hillary Clinton--

-[Lawrence] Shut your face.
-[laughter]

[yelling on recording]

[Acaster]
Say your prayers!

Say your prayers, mate!

Say your prayers!

[laughter]

Say your prayers! Say your prayers!
Say your prayers!

When it kicks off, I tend to shout out
"say your prayers" a lot.

[Acaster]
Say your prayers, man!

You better say your prayers right now!

[Lawrence]
Silence!

I would probably be half flamingo,

but I'm not fussed about which half.

Hands down the worst answer
I've ever heard to that question.

[laughter]

[Lawrence]
James, stop name-calling. Understood?

[Acaster]
No problemo.

[Lawrence]
Sorry, not flamingo, pelican.

I'd like to be half a pelican.

[Mason]
That's worse than flamingo, you fuckwit.

-[Lawrence] Watch your tone, Mr. Mason.
-[Mason] You watch your tone.

[yelling on recording]

[Acaster]
Say your prayers, Mr. Mason!

-Say your prayers!
-[laughter]

Say--! Say your prayers, man!

Say your prayers!

I'd start saying your prayers
if I was you.

[boing noises on recording]

Got five seconds to say your prayers.

Say your prayers
and make them loud so we can hear.

-[cymbals crash on recording]
-Bow your heads, let's pray.

Divide into prayer groups
and fucking pray.

[claxon toots on recording]

[fart noise on recording]

[comedy noises on recording]

Say your prayers!

Say your prayers!

Say your prayers!

Say your prayers!

Say your prayers!

Say your prayers!

Say your prayers! Say your prayers!

♪ Somebody once told me ♪

[laughter]

♪ I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed ♪

♪ She was looking kind of dumb
With her finger and her thumb ♪

♪ In the shape of an L on her forehead ♪

♪ Well, the years start coming
And they don't stop coming ♪

♪ Fed to the rules
And I hit the ground running ♪

[music stops]

[scattered laughter]

Recorded that during a rough patch.

[laughter]

It was really bad, man, actually.

She'd left me, the case was falling apart.

The captain was acting
like a grade-A jerk.

I had a bit of a wobble.

That's normal, right? Isn't it?
Having a wobble?

It's pretty normal.

I remember...

it was National Fondue Day again.

[scattered laughter]

A year to the day.

I woke up,
I knew it was gonna be a bad day.

My electric toothbrush
died in my mouth that morning.

[laughter]

Not a good omen, is it?

Very few good days start
with something dying in your mouth...

[laughter]

as a rule.

It was early in the morning,

but already I had a can
of Dr Pepper in one hand,

and I'd like to say
a cup of punch in the other.

It was a rough day. I was...

I was going ladle to mouth.

[laughter]

Pot of bread sauce
bubbling away on the stove.

Wanted to try a reverse fondue.

You know when you dip solid cheese
into liquid bread?

[laughter]

I don't know what I--
I was tipsy as hell. I was...

[laughter]

I was blind tipsy.

I got in my car, and I just drove.

I didn't even know where I was gonna go.

I thought I might go to the seaside
and cheer myself up

by having a go on-- You know those
pictures you put your head in?

[laughter]

A few. It's never everyone who knows
what I mean when I say "pictures you--"

It's very hard to get it across,
what I mean when I say that.

I mean, they've been around forever.

They predate all of you,
pictures you put your head in.

You've all seen them. You've all--

Actually, I'm gonna say

you've all put your head
in a picture you put your head in.

I'm pretty sure I'm--
I'm on solid ground to say that.

No one knows what I'm talking about
when I say pictures you put your head in,

because even though
they've been around forever,

no one's named them yet.
Why has no one named them yet?

[laughter]

There's no official name for them.

I had to come up with
pictures you put your head in myself.

I brainstormed that on a train.

That's not a real official thing.

It's 'cause no one ever talks about them.

Admit it, this is the longest
you've ever heard anyone

talk about pictures you put your head in.

So taboo this section of the show.

[laughter]

Pictures you put your head in.

I feel like you still don't know
what I'm talking about.

They were invented in the olden times
by an artist who couldn't do faces.

Does that help anyone?
Pictures you put your head in?

They're the opposite of masks.
Does that help anyone at all?

The opposite of masks.

[laughter]

The drive to the seaside on your own

is the loneliest drive
you'll ever do in your life.

You want to have your friends and family
in the car for that drive.

You get to the point in the journey

where you can see the sea
for the first time,

you get to announce it
to the rest of the car.

You point at it strong and true
and say in a clear voice,

"I can see the sea."

Everyone's like...

"Yeah, yeah.

[laughter]

That is the sea. There was a few
false alarms early in the journey.

We got overexcited by the sky.

-[laughter]
-But that is the sea this time."

It's easy when you seem them
side by side, isn't it? It's easier.

When you're on your own,
you look out the window

and the sea just looks back at you like...

"Who's gonna believe you, mate?"

[laughter]

It's gutting.
I love saying "I can see the sea."

There's very few opportunities
you get to say it.

You can say it when you can see the sea.

[laughter]

Maybe during an eye test.

[laughter]

I was walking up and down the pier,

trying to find a decent picture you put
your head in that I could put my head in.

Most of them were in use.
Fair play, popular product.

There was one that was free.

A little kiddie's one.

Head hole still the same size
as for adults.

You read into that what you will.

It was a double-header.

A picture you put your heads in.

It was an old English bobby.

He was catching a burglar,

like a striped jumper and a swag bag.

As I went to put my head in--

[watch beeps]

-As I went to put my head...
-[laughter]

in the holes, I'm looking
at the cop and the robber.

I didn't know where to put my head.
I've been undercover so long...

[scattered laughter]

I don't know who I am anymore.

I know that no one knows who they are.

None of you lot know who you are, do you?

That's why we have to go out
and buy mugs and fridge magnets

that have our Christian names
written on them in calligraphy,

and then a paragraph underneath

about how wonderful everybody
with that first name is.

[laughter]

"You're kind and sharing.

Greeting the dawn of each new day

with a heart full of optimism
and eyes brimming with hope.

You're never untrue.

And those lucky enough to know you
know they're fortunate

to have such a loyal and selfless friend."

Apparently that describes Bob Marley,

Bob Hoskins...

[laughter]

and Robert Mugabe.

[laughter]

One of those gentlemen
swerved quite the bullet there.

[laughter]

When she kicked me out,
she said, "I love you...

but I don't feel like I know you."

And that's also how I feel...

about Dr Pepper.

[laughter]

As I put my head
in the policeman's head hole,

I thought about what she'd said,
and I thought about her,

and I realized not only did I not know
who I was anymore,

I don't know who she is either.

That's messed up. She's my wife.
I should know who she is, right?

Do you ever get like that?

Do you ever wake up in the night,
look at your partner asleep next to you?

You study their face
as they sleep and think...

"Who are you?

[laughter]

What--? I don't even know you.
How'd you get here?"

[scattered laughter]

When I first met her, she was perfect.

I was at a party with my friend Daryl.

She walked in, I was like,
"Daryl, you see that woman?

I'm gonna marry that woman."

Six months later, we were married.

It's the only time that's ever paid off
for me. I used to say that a lot.

[laughter]

It was perfect.
I opened up and let her in my life.

As the years went by,
I dropped my guard more and more.

As soon as my guard was all the way down,
she changed, overnight.

Undercover-copped me. I didn't like
how it felt to be undercover-copped.

There's a point in every single
undercover-cop case

where you're watching
the target get suspicious.

They go crazy, they get paranoid,

reading too much
into every detail of every day.

I got anxious, needy, and insecure.

You might be thinking,
"Oh, just be yourself, mate.

Be yourself in a relationship."

What if they don't like you, man?

[laughter]

What if every relationship
you've ever been in

is somebody slowly figuring out
they didn't like you

as much as they hoped they would?

[scattered laughter]

One day I'll have the guts
to end the show there.

[laughter]

Just that line and then a blackout.
I don't even bring the lights up.

You've got to find your way out
in the dark.

With that wriggling around in your head.
"Oh, I hope he's okay."

[applause]

As I knelt there, I realized...

if you've got your head in a children's
picture you put your head in...

for two...

and you're an adult...

you're on your own, and...

yeah, you're crying...

[laughter]

it looks really peculiar
if no one's taking your photograph.

[laughter]

In the end, I just put my arm
through the burglar's face hole

and took a selfie.

[laughter]

Needn't have bothered.
Turns out if you are crying on your own

in a picture you put your head in,
strangers will stop to take photos.

[laughter]

It's the lowest point in my life.
I felt pathetic. Look at me.

I'm a undercover cop
pretending to be a stand-up comedian.

The only thing lamer than that
would be a stand-up comedian

pretending to be an undercover cop.

Imagine that loser.

[laughter]

Imagine him going on stage
night after night,

claiming to a room full of people that
he's something that he's clearly not.

Not just for one joke, by the way.

For a whole show.

[laughter]

At least I'm not that guy,
going on stage night after night,

using the whole undercover-cop thing

as a way of talking about
his own personal problems

he's been having this year.

And he thinks he's being all smart,
disguising it in the subtext,

but there's this bit
right at the end of the show

where it becomes painfully obvious
what's happened to him this year.

[laughter]

And when that happened to him,
he did what most people would do.

He started questioning himself.
"Is it me?"

Overanalyzing who he was.

Worried that he spends most of his time
pretending to be someone that he's not,

all over a woman who,
at the end of the day,

just didn't understand him.

And yeah, it is quite petty to dwell

on an offhand remark
made by a Pret A Manger employee.

-[laughter]
-She can judge, but she doesn't know.

He might not know who he is, but...

he knows what he's too good for.

[laughter]

Is--? Obviously who--?

Who cares what--?
It doesn't matter what she thinks.

It's about accepting yourself
at the end of the day.

You focus on her 'cause it's easier.

Thanks for coming.

[laughter]

It's been a pleasure to talk to you all.

Uh, see you another time. My name...

[laughter]

is James Acaster.

Death comes to us all.

[laughter]

[cheering and applause]

[theme song plays]
