[Acaster]
The universe began... with a big bang.

But what came before that?

This is the question I asked myself
every night as a child.

[scattered laughter]

And back then,
I was a little Christian boy,

so the answer always... was God.

And I was like...

"Cool.

[laughter]

God came before that."

But what came before that?

And I'd be like...

"Maybe some sort of egg.

[laughter]

Or a seed or a pip, something like that."

Or maybe not quite nothing,
but nearly nothing,

like one notch above darkness
and loads of dry ice shifting around,

and one long drawn-out note
on a synthesizer.

[scattered laughter]

Or maybe just like a new smell,

like a freshly opened tube
of tennis balls.

Or maybe what came before that
was just papadums.

You know, just to tide us over
before everything begins.

[laughter]

Don't fill up on them,
the whole universe is coming.

You've had four papadums.
Eyes bigger than your belly.

You're gonna spoil
the whole universe for yourself.

[laughter]

Or maybe what came before that
was just a little girl.

Just a little girl.

She's six, or thereabouts.

Happy. Right at the start of everything,
a happy little six-year-old girl

wearing her favorite red dress
before anything else even exists.

Right at the start of everything,
a happy little six-year-old girl

wearing her favorite red dress.

She's smiling, sitting down
next to a toy clown,

and they're both playing
noughts and crosses on a chalkboard.

[laughter]

Or maybe what came before that
was... just an audience.

Just an audience,
just sitting in the dark.

Just wondering...

"Has it started yet?
Is it gonna start in a minute?"

[laughter]

Not quite sure when the start is.

Maybe as the lights fade up on the stage,

they think "Oh, this must be the start."
Maybe they start applauding.

Just gently at first,
and then building it up.

[applause]

And then when the music comes in,
they start going wild and crazy...

[music plays]

and welcome to the stage James Acaster.

[cheering]

Yeah.

Let's start off
with some celebrity gossip.

That's why we're here,
that's why we come to the comedy.

[laughter]

Now, let's say I happen to know

about a month and a half ago,
a certain celebrity

got himself kicked out of a karaoke bar.

Yeah, look at your faces.

Who did that, eh? Who did that?

This won't surprise you.

None other than Jorge Galleguillos.

[laughter]

Yeah, you remember
Jorge Galleguillos, don't you?

You remember Jorge Galleguillos?

It's... It's been a while, to be fair.

What's it been?
Seven years since he got out the mine?

About seven years, isn't it,
since the Chilean miners?

But they are massive celebrities now,
you cannot deny that.

I got some celebrity gossip
about Jorge Galleguillos.

I'm not keeping it to myself either.

[laughter]

Kicked out of a karaoke bar.

Jorge! I mean, I know...

Look, you expect it from Florencio Avalos.

You don't expect it
from Jorge Galleguillos, do you?

He's the bad boy of the group,
if anyone is.

Here's a real scoop,
weren't even a karaoke bar.

He only thought it was.

Weren't, just a normal pub.

A normal pub playing really loud music,

with a TV in the corner showing
the news with the subtitles on.

[laughter]

He was singing the details
of the Greek financial crisis

to the tune of "Livin' on a Prayer."

-[laughter]
-Classic Jorge Galleguillos.

Give you some more celebrity gossip
since you're so hungry.

I didn't know you were so hungry.
Open wide.

[laughter]

Heads up, this next celebrity
is a bit more obscure.

[laughter]

Fair warning.

It's Jimmy Sanchez.

Most of you won't even remember
Jimmy Sanchez.

I'll jog your memory. Jimmy Sanchez,
he was the 29th miner out of the mine.

Jimmy Sanchez, do you remember him now?

Of course it was right after
Julio Aguilera, wasn't he?

Now...

when I tell you this bit of gossip,

some of you will be like,
"Big deal. Why is that even gossip?

Who cares?"

Others will be like,
"That is disgusting and unnatural,

and I'm glad you told me."

Right? Jimmy Sanchez,
he has hot drinks with hot meals.

[laughter]

I'm not exaggerating. Like a cup of tea
and a bowl of minestrone.

They're both fluids, by the way.

Alternating mouthfuls back and forth.

How does your mouth
even know the difference, mate?

-What you playing at?
-[laughter]

That doesn't leave this room, by the way.

[laughter]

[scattered laughter]

[laughter]

-Pedro Cortez...
-[laughter]

You remember him. He was the 11th
and 18th miner out the mine.

He forgot something,
had to go back for it.

[laughter]

I think it was a charger.
Don't quote me on that,

but I believe it was a charger
that he left in the mine.

Pedro Cortez, he wears
days-of-the-week socks,

but deliberately wears them
on the wrong day,

just so his socks don't forget
who's in charge.

-[laughter]
-What a weirdo. That is eccentric.

Good to see we got some proper
Chilean miners fans in tonight.

That doesn't always happen.

Hardcore fans, am I right?

Since before they got stuck.

[laughter]

When it was all about the mining.

[laughter]

Anyway, we're not here to gossip,
thank you.

[scattered laughter]

What I really want to talk to you about
tonight is a friend of mine.

He, um... He works in a casino.

And one day, he was...

Uh, it-- Is it--?
Is dice plural and die singular?

Or is die plural?

Anyway, he killed two people by mistake.

[laughter]

I think they're both dice.

[laughter]

I say he's my friend,
he's not really my friend.

He's not my friend, I'm-- I'm on the jury.

-I shouldn't say "friend," should I?
-[laughter]

I shouldn't say "friend,"
they made that very clear.

"Stop calling him your friend."

I see him every day.
He seems like a nice guy.

Jury duty, man. Exciting.

I've wanted to do jury duty my whole life.

Always felt like in my heart I'm a juror.
That's who I am, you know?

Always imagined
what that letter would say.

It all starts with that one letter.

I brought it with me tonight.

Thought I'd start the show
by reading it to you

so you can all feel the same level
of excitement that I felt.

Here it is, the jury letter.

"Dear Judge,

please pick me to be on the jury
at any big trials you've got coming up.

[laughter]

Trust me, I've got a head for it.
James Acaster."

[laughter]

The trial's actually over now.

I'm still not meant to be talking about it
in any environment, let alone this.

This is highly inappropriate, the old...

The old "on stage."

[scattered laughter]

But I'm a comedian. All I can do
is talk about what's going on in my life.

Plus it looks pretty good
if you're the only member of the jury

constantly taking notes.
They don't know it's for material.

[laughter]

Top of the class.

It's a sweet gig, jury duty, a sweet gig.

I recommend it to all of you.

First thing they did,
they got the whole jury,

put us up in a hotel, paid for everything.

[Acaster chuckles]

Suckers, man. Total suckers.

They'd save so much money
if every time there's a trial on,

they just phone the local hotel,

find out who was staying there anyway,

make them the jury.

[laughter]

Get a Dutch family on holiday,
they're used to working as a team.

[laughter]

That hotel could not have come
at a better time. I'd just moved house.

My new flat was a tad too drafty
for my liking.

I'd recently ordered
a draft excluder by post.

Best way to buy a draft excluder
is by post.

When they deliver it,
they post it through the door,

it drops through the letterbox
onto the floor.

[laughter]

-Already it's paying for its own postage.
-[laughter]

Toasty.

[scattered laughter]

I'd moved to West London.

Used to live in South London.

Different times, I was a different person.

Uh, used to be in a gang.

[laughter]

SW6 gang.

The area of London we're from.

It was our name, and it's what we'd shout
at other gangs we didn't like much.

Like if we saw the SW5 gang, for example,

we'd shout at them, "SW6!"

[scattered laughter]

That's smart.

That lets them know trouble's brewing.

Lets them know
who's shouting at them as well.

They could be facing
the opposite direction,

not even aware that we're in the vicinity.

Soon as they hear us shout that,
[clicks fingers] instantly they know

who's shouting at them,
that's the genius of it.

A lot of you guys, you see someone
you know in the street,

you shout their name,

they've got to turn around and be like,

"Who's that? Who's shouting at me?"
It's a waste of time.

Shout your own name.

[laughter]

That's what I do. "Oi, James Acaster."

[laughter]

Now it's up to them.

They ain't got time, they keep walking.
I'm not taking that personally.

Plus if I mistake a stranger
for someone I know, doesn't matter.

[chuckles] Got my name right.

[laughter]

I remember once, back in the day,
we were out and about,

SW6 crew taking no shit on the stomp.

Me, Reg, Hughie, Mr. Mason,
my main man Lawrence.

We looked across the road, we saw them,

SW5 gang.

As soon as I saw them, I was cross.

[laughter]

I don't know if you've ever
been in a gang,

but, phwoar, heads-up,
you get cross a lot.

[laughter]

We shouted at them, "SW6!"

As per.

[laughter]

They shouted back at us, "SW5!"

Which we expected,
but it still made us angry.

[laughter]

"SW6," back at them.
"SW5," back at us.

Back and forth, back and forth for ages.

Till eventually, I got so overstimulated

that I shouted out my entire postcode.

[laughter]

In full.

And that is why I had to move house.

[laughter]

What do you need to be a good juror?

Strong opinions.

Uh, I got strong opinions
by the truckload, man.

Like best film I ever saw at the cinema,
without question,

was the Stephen Hawking biopic
The Theory of Everything.

Loved it. Should have been called
Look Who's Hawking,

that's my only criticism.

[laughter]

I don't know who named that film,
but they hoofed that over the bar.

Wave that franchise goodbye.

[laughter]

Saw it, I loved it.

Couldn't believe my luck,
the film was so good.

Guy behind me hated it, opposite to me.

He was grumpy as well.

Proper grumpy guts. Had a go at me
at one point 'cause I was snacking.

Get over yourself, granddad.
I'll do what I like.

In his defense, I was eating
a big bag of fortune cookies.

[laughter]

I was cracking them open,
reading them out loud,

it was disruptive.

[laughter]

I love fortune cookies.

I get proper fortune cookies as well,
with proper fortunes in them.

None of the mainstream stuff
you guys get in restaurants, no offense.

Tell you what you want to hear
all the time.

You open them up, "Well, done, mate."

[laughter]

It's not for me.

I go online, and I order myself
some harsh truths.

[laughter]

The other day I got a whole bag.

Every single cookie said "trust no one."

That is not a coincidence.

[laughter]

Coming out the cinema,

this guy hated Look Who's Hawking,
hated it.

I hear him turn to his friend, he goes,

"Pfft. Well, that's three hours of my life
I'm not getting back."

I thought,
"I've got some bad news for this guy."

[scattered laughter]

Every hour of your life...

[laughter]

you're never getting back.
They're gone forever.

Time is not refundable.

Death is the end.

[laughter]

And I know that
'cause five minutes earlier,

I'd read it in a fortune cookie.

[laughter]

It's a rough bag.

[scattered laughter]

And maybe death's not the end.
I mean, who the hell am I?

Maybe reincarnation's real.

Maybe you get born again,
you live a whole other life,

you actually do get
all the hours back that way.

So if you ever see a Buddhist monk
come out the cinema

and go, "That's three hours of my life
I'm not getting back"...

that is truly tragic.

[laughter]

He hated the film so much...

he lost his faith.

[laughter]

Sometimes, I hit the town with my friends
on the booze. So what?

-Next morning, I wake up...
-[laughter]

I can't remember
what happened the night before.

Can't remember anything.

If someone asks me how last night was,

I never go, [scoffs] "Six hours of my life
I'm not getting back,"

-even though I can't even remember it.
-[laughter]

If someone asks me how last night was,

I always say something like,

"Can't remember it,
so it must have been good."

[laughter]

What film could hope for that review?

[laughter]

"How was the film last night?"

"Brilliant. I had to make myself sick
just to make it to the end.

[laughter]

Made myself sick, can't remember it.

Next day was an absolute write-off.
Best film ever.

[laughter]

Gonna see it again next week
with the lads,

every week the exact same film.

Never changes, never gets any better
than the first time we saw it.

Ninety quid a time."

[laughter]

Britain.

[laughter]

Little routine about Britain for you.

I don't want to get anyone's backs up.
I'm not having a go at a night out.

I love a night out, yip.

I went on a...

[laughter]

I went on a banging night out once
with the jury.

[laughter]

All 12 of us hitting the town,
cutting it up,

being inconsiderate, having a blast.

[laughter]

My first night out as a single man.

I was dressed to impress,
had my best tie on.

Paisley, paisley,
makes the girls go crazly.

[laughter]

I was chatting to a lady at one point.

It was going well, actually.

I was, um-- I don't know if you guys
know what negging is,

but negging is where you deliberately
undermine their confidence,

and then you subtly criticize them,

then they become vulnerable
to your advances.

And, uh, she was negging me big time.

-[laughter]
-Mm.

Message received loud and clear.

I was loving it, she was going crazly,
no complaints.

[laughter]

And I'm no stranger to getting negged.

Every time I'm up in the club,
all the women be negging me.

[laughter]

I'm like, "Who to choose?"

[laughter]

Form a queue, ladies. Or don't.

I know your game.
Scatter, make me want it more.

[laughter]

Man, that was a great night out.

Went down in history,
that night was so great.

At one point, Daniel, he's on the jury,

went to the toilet, asked me to hold
his pint for him while he was in there.

Oh, big mistake, Daniel.
What you thinking?

I've been up to high jinks all night.

I'm obliged to do a prank
if you leave me alone with your drink.

This is a classic prank.

Always do this to someone
who leaves me alone with their drink.

I went round the bar
using his pint to propose toasts with...

deliberately proposing toasts to things

-I knew he disagreed with.
-[laughter]

[Acaster snickers]

He comes back, has a sip, he's like,
"Ugh. What you done to that?"

-[Acaster snickers]
-[laughter]

"You just drank to the service charge
being included in the bill.

[laughter]

You just drank to those bedside lamps
that don't have the switch on the cord,

like it's convenient,

but have it on the neck of the lamp
under the bulb.

Sort of a really stiff bolt

you've got to force through
the neck of the lamp somehow.

And you can't even do it like that,

you've got to get your whole hand
up inside the lampshade

in a backwards, like, gooseneck manner.
It's really uncomfortable.

You can't even see what you're doing
'cause the lampshade's in the way.

You've got to look at the top of
the lampshade to see what you're doing,

and then you switch it,
and then it blinds you when it goes on.

You just drank to those lamps.
You love those lamps, Daniel.

Cheers."

[scattered laughter]

That was the best part
of doing jury service,

getting to know
this whole new group of people.

Loved them.
Legends every last one of them.

Obviously, you can't get too close.
Everyone's a suspect.

They were nice.

[laughter]

All from different walks of life.

Jan was a teacher,
Bill was a bus driver,

Hugh was a hype man for a log flume.

-Different people...
-[laughter]

from different walks of life.

Not sure everyone knows
what a hype man for a log flume is

looking around the room.

You looked a bit confused, sir.
What's your name?

-John.
-John. I see.

You went to shake my hand there, John.

Your hand kind of came out.

I'm not-- I'm not that close.
But, hey, listen...

[laughter]

I want you to know,
on a normal day I'd be right in there.

I don't want you to feel
like that was a diss.

[laughter]

John, do you know what
a hype man for a log flume is?

Do you know--? I mean,
how much of it did you understand?

Let's break it down into...

[John] It would be a man at the top of
the log flume, rather than at the bottom.

A man...

You think it'd be a man at the top
of the log flume telling people to go on?

-[John] Yeah.
-Well, John,

I don't want to hurt your feelings.
That is wrong.

[laughter]

But it's okay.

So you know what a log flume is.
You've already demonstrated that.

A hype man, do you know
what a hype man is?

[John]
Someone who makes it sound better.

Someone who makes it sound better,
makes it sound good. Yeah.

So... I can't believe I'm having
to walk you to the door here, John.

[laughter]

It's fine.

What do you think a hype man
for a log flume is?

[John] Somebody who gets jigged up
for a log flume.

Somebody who gets all jigged up
for the log flume.

-John, can I say something to you?
-[John] Sure.

Never, ever don't believe in yourself
ever again.

[laughter]

You're absolutely clear.
That was very good.

[applause]

Lovely work from John.

Lovely work from John.

That is what a hype man
for a log flume is.

Jan was a teacher,
Bill was a bus driver,

Hugh was a hype man for a log flume...

Gwen was a masseuse.

Big respect for any masseuses.

Masseuses? Masseusi?

[laughter]

Massoise.

[laughter]

I knew it was massoise really,
I'm playing dumb.

[laughter]

I've tried to give massage
in the past to girlfriends.

Not easy, is it?

And just normal massage, by the way,
not sexy stuff.

Drag your goddamn minds
out of the dirty gutter.

[laughter]

Just normal mass-- Normal stuff, you know.

Just normal.

[laughter]

The normal stuff. Normally, what,
you're in bed normally, aren't you?

-Yeah.
-[laughter]

You don't clear the coffee table
for it, do you?

[laughter]

You're in bed, aren't you, normally,
for a massage?

With a partner.

Nighttime bed, fair to say?

Yeah, nighttime bed.

Not in the morning.
You don't start the day with a massage.

-That's beyond decadent.
-[laughter]

With your face in a bowl of grapes. Oh!

"Good morning, sultan.

I didn't know the sultan
was in this morning."

Nighttime bed, isn't it? It's nighttime.

You've finished your book, that's done.

Fuck off, you fucking nerd.

-The book's done.
-[laughter]

That's how I speak to my books.
I'm the one who read them, I don't care.

You've got to know your place
in the food chain. I'm one above books.

Every time I turn up to someone's house,
I'm straight to the bookshelf,

and I'm like, "I found some dweebs,"
and I punch them all in the spine,

and that gives me
the confidence for supper.

[scattered laughter]

Nighttime bed, isn't it?
It's nighttime bed.

You've done your books,
the lights are out,

and you're both lying down,
you've got your eyes closed,

and fair to say, at this point,
only one of you

is even aware that a massage
is about to take place.

[laughter]

The other one is oblivious,
they've got their eyes shut,

and they're thinking--
This is what they think in their head,

they believe,
"I'm about to go to sleep now."

That's what they believe.
"I've had a long day today.

I had so many jobs
that I needed to do today.

Done every single job
that I needed to do today,

and I'm pretty sure
there's no more jobs for me to do.

Yeah, no more jobs.

I'm in bed next to the person
I trust most in this entire planet.

The last thing I'm expecting
is an ambush of any sort.

Yeah, no more jobs."

Some of you do, don't you?

You get in bed, you turn off the light,

and then you shout, "No more jobs,"
then you go to sleep.

[laughter]

That's what a lot of you all do.

Some of you don't even
refer to it as sleep.

You just refer to it as "no more jobs,"
that's what you call it.

You have no more jobs,

then you wake up in the morning,
then it's jobs again,

and then no more jobs, and then jobs--

Isn't that just your whole life?

There's no more jobs and jobs
on a constant loop,

till eventually one day,

permanently no more jobs forever.

Just stretching into the distance,

and really missing jobs
at that point, isn't it?

You really miss jobs
when it's no more jobs forever.

Too much of a good thing, the old death.

[laughter]

You're in bed, aren't you?
Books are done, no more--

"No more jobs," you've shouted that.

[laughter]

Then your partner will lean over,

in the dark, like a coward...

[laughter]

Like a lily-livered coward...

and they'll go...

"I've got a genuine muscular complaint...

[laughter]

that I really should get seen to
by a trained professional.

However...

how would you like to improvise
a massage on me

with your zero expertise?"

[laughter]

"Would I ever?
Let's get this light back on again...

[laughter]

and do jobs. Clocking in, boss.

Clocking in."

Then they lie facedown on the bed.

And when you're lying facedown
on a bed to receive a massage,

you really start to appreciate
the value of the face hole...

[laughter]

in a traditional massage table.

It's there for a reason it turns out.

As soon as you get rid of it
and move things onto a bed,

nine times out of ten,

they end up turning their neck
so far in one direction

that by now the massage is really doing
more harm than good.

[laughter]

Then the "masseuse"...

will assume the position.

[laughter]

Which, if you've ever received a massage
from a partner before,

you know the position in question
is sitting on them.

[laughter]

You know, like a bully does.

[laughter]

Just sitting on them like a bully...

Again, I don't know if you've ever
paid for a professional massage,

this move rarely crops up.

[laughter]

They don't park themselves on your butt,
it's too familiar.

[laughter]

You get what you pay for, you cheapskate.

[scattered laughter]

Sitting on you,
and then they start guessing.

Having a flying guess all over your back.

[laughter]

Doing moves they've half-remembered
from films and stuff.

[scattered laughter]

You can't see what I'm doing
at the back there,

I'm using the heels of my hands...

putting those either side of the spine,

then you want to put your full weight
on that, in the hopes that that's okay.

[laughter]

Not your back, is it? Who gives a shit?

[laughter]

Roll the dice on a loved one.

[scattered laughter]

And then you want to push it out
in a pattern--

This is very important.

You want to make a pattern
that from where you are

just looks nice.
That's what you want to do.

Pleasing to your eyes,
if not to their actual back.

Nice and symmetrical all the way up.

No one ever got hurt
with symmetry, did they?

[laughter]

Bit of shoulder work while you're there.

You're not stingy. You're gonna
give them some shoulder work, aren't you?

What you're doing there,
just gathering all the skin and muscle...

[laughter]

in a nice chunky pinch...

[laughter]

-then just let it go and do it again.
-[laughter]

Move it somewhere else, put it back
where it was, that's that move.

Like an arcade claw
that never wins anything,

never picks up any toys.

Absolute waste of everybody's time.

Then the masseuse will dismount.

The person who received
the massage, they'll say,

"Oh, thank you so much, my darling.

I love you so much, my love.

Thank you, my darling, that was lovely."

And they'll go, "No problem.

Um, before we go to bed,
my back's been hurting all day as well.

It really hurts pretty badly today,
actually, more than usual.

Um, would you be able to give me
a massage as well in return?"

And they'll go, "No."

[laughter]

And that is every relationship ever.

One of you is more selfish
than the other one,

and that is why it's doomed to fail.

Welcome to the show, fuck you.

[laughter]

I know that's a bit tense, that bit,
for a few people.

You're sitting next to the person
who you're in a relationship with

who you know for a fact
is more selfish than you.

[laughter]

And you don't want to laugh
and let on that you know,

'cause you don't want the argument today.
I'm aware of that.

Don't worry,
if you are that person, right,

who's with a real selfish person,

this is what you do.
Next time you give them a massage,

halfway through just go,
"I'll just be back in a minute,"

and leave them facedown on the bed,

and then never come back again.

[laughter]

People often ask me, "James...

who was your favorite member of the jury?"

[scattered laughter]

My favorite member of the jury was James.

Not me. [chuckles]

Not me. There was another James
on the jury. There's two Jameses.

It was pretty confusing having two people
with the same name on the jury.

How we made it less confusing,

everyone would call him James 1,

and me, Wolf. I got to choose my own name.

[laughter]

Least favorite member
of the jury was Lucas.

Eurgh. I hated him so much.

I hated him. He thought he was better
than everyone else.

He thought he was better than me

just 'cause he's my age and he's got kids.

[scoffs] Who cares?

I don't feel inadequate
if someone's my age and they got kids.

Only time I feel inadequate
is if I'm sat in the back of their car

and they have to open the door
for me 'cause it's child-locked.

[laughter]

End up staring through the window
like a helpless little baby. Just...

[scattered laughter]

Then when they open the door,
just to complete the whole thing,

I insist they unbuckle me.

[laughter]

Even make it difficult like a kid would.
I'm a wriggler and a half.

[scattered laughter]

I hate Lucas.

One of those people that just
went around slagging people off

all the time to their faces.

You know one of those people,
 just going round,

just slagging people off,
being rude to everybody,

and then backing it up by going,
"That's just me.

You've got to get used to it.
I speak my mind.

That's just me. I shoot from the hip.

I just tell people what I think of them."

Why?

-[laughter]
-Why you doing that for, mate?

Just think it in your head
like the rest of us.

You're not the only person
who hates everyone, thank you.

-[laughter]
-We all hate everyone.

We just don't tell them to their faces
'cause we're probably wrong.

You know what I do when I hate someone?

I find someone else who also hates them,

then we go off in a private room,

slag them off behind their back
like nice people.

[laughter]

I'm a gentleman. Going round
slagging people off to their faces.

He'd come up to me every day, [whines]

"You shouldn't eat
your fortune cookies in court.

[whining]

You shouldn't have booked a dentist
appointment on the day of the verdict."

[whining]

So judgmental,
just judging people all the time.

It's like he's never heard the fable
of the goose and the sloth.

[scattered laughter]

There once was a sloth...

[laughter]

and it was a nimble sloth,

not like all the other sloths
in the sloth kingdom.

It was swift, it did a lot of cardio.

[laughter]

Chin-ups in the branches
and running along the river

and Zumba.

And one Tuesday around brunch time,

the sloth was sitting up
high, high in a sycamore-- [laughs]

-In a sycamore tree...
-[laughter]

in the jungle.

[laughter]

Just spinning its web.

[laughter]

[scattered applause]

Spinning its big old sloth web
and catching--

What do they catch in their webs, sloths?

Pineapples, isn't it?

[laughter]

Catching all the pineapples
in his big sloth web... for supper,

and then the sloth
opened up its window

and looked out...

It's a stained-glass window
that opened like that.

And looked down at the jungle room floor
and all the cobbles.

And, uh...

[laughter]

out of all the fog and the steam
came galloping...

[microphone thuds]

a goose.

[laughter]

And the goose clip-clopped up to the tree.

Clip-clop, barking at all the cats.
Clip-clop, clip-clop...

[laughter]

And the goose yelled up at the sloth,

"Look at you, sloth!

So full of vim.

You bring shame on your people."

And with those words,
the goose did tunnel away...

[scattered laughter]

zig-zagging across the desert dunes.

[laughter]

But the words of the goose
stuck in the sloth's mind.

With each passing day,
the sloth got lazier and slower

till it was as slow and as lazy
as all the sloths in the sloth kingdom.

One bank holiday...

[laughter]

the goose was trotting along a meadow...

of wheat...

and corn...

and oats. The kind of meadow
used for making Cheerios.

-A Cheerios meadow.
-[laughter]

Just bounding along on all fours...

and crowing gaily at the moon.

A cockle-doodle-doo.
A cockle-doodle-doo to you.

When out of the bracken...

[laughter]

swept a crocodile.

And he pinned the goose
to the ground with his mighty talons,

butting him with his horns

and pushing him further and further
into the lava.

-And the goose...
-[laughter]

The goose cried out in sonar.

He cried out, "Help me!
Help me, for I am in peril!"

But the sloth, who was in a tire swing
down by the bayou,

was too slow.

He was too lazy and too slow
to make it there in time,

and the crocodile ate the goose,

and the goose died in his belly,

and a nearby pig said, "He deserved that."

And then the crocodile
drove over and ate the sloth.

And the moral of that story is...

-I hate Lucas. I hate him!
-[laughter]

-I hate him so much.
-[applause]

Ah, I hate Lucas.
I hate him with all my heart.

[cheering]

And I got him for Secret Santa. Gutted.

[laughter]

The only member of that jury
that I didn't like,

I got him for Secret Santa.
What are the odds?

[laughter]

It's all right though.
I'm really good at Secret Santa.

I went up to him in the break room.

I'll be like, "Hey, Lucas.

You, uh...? You got any hobbies?"

"Yeah, I love skiing."

"You got any hobbies
up to the value of £10?"

[laughter]

"Yeah, I'm really getting into
my herbal teas."

I remembered that.

I went off, I bought him a bandanna.

[laughter]

He'll never guess it was me.

Secret Santa.

[laughter]

Keep it a secret, throw them off the scent
any way you can.

Too many people make it obvious
that they're your Secret Santa.

You know what I received for Secret Santa?

Two tickets to a log flume.
I wonder who?

[laughter]

Hardly a head scratcher, is it?

[laughter]

That was pretty much
the best Christmas of my life.

The jury Christmas. It meant a lot to me.

I think it's 'cause we're all
from different faiths.

I was raised Christian,
but I'm agnostic now, definitely.

And there's a few people...

[laughter]

My faith is like a rock.

[scattered laughter]

There was one Christian
on the jury called Oliver,

and he invited the whole jury

to go to his church on Christmas Eve

to go to the Christingle service.

What...

[laughter]

is a Christingle?!

A Christingle is an orange...

and it's got a red ribbon
tied around it...

-And already that's weird, isn't it?
-[laughter]

Just so you know, I'm not halfway
through this description yet.

That's an orange with a red ribbon
tied around it.

Never any excuse to tie
a red ribbon around an orange,

unless you're gonna fly
somewhere on holiday,

you want to check
the orange in beforehand,

so that when it comes round
on that conveyor belt,

you can tell it apart
from all the other oranges.

You don't want to go home with a satsuma,

or, God forbid, a clementine.

[laughter]

It's an orange, it's got a red ribbon
tied around it,

and four cocktail sticks
stuck in the top of the orange.

And then we skewer raisins
and Dolly Mixtures onto those.

And then we get a long, thin candle,

drive that into the top of the orange
and light it.

And then a small child...

[laughter]

carries that... down the aisle
of the church on Christmas Eve,

and nobody questions it.

[laughter]

Against all the odds, the kid
comes out of it looking pretty boss.

And all the elements represent
something different.

The orange represents
all the vitamin C in the world.

[laughter]

The ribbon represents
the fashion industry.

[laughter]

The cocktail sticks represent
competitive javelin.

The sweets and the raisins
represent regret,

and the candle represents

the dwindling popularity of wax museums.

[laughter]

When I was a little Christian boy,
they gave me that Christingle.

Before I even walked down the aisle,

all I wanted to do,
eat the raisins, eat the sweets.

I had an agenda, sue me.

And the grown-ups,
sensing that twinkle in your eye,

they give you a look as if to say,

"Word to the wise, you little punkhead.

Keep your lips off of that Christingle."

You did as you were told
'cause you were a kid.

I'm an adult now.

I eat Christingles whenever I like.

[laughter]

I don't even wait for Christmas.

You think I got in trouble
for eating fortune cookies in the cinema.

When you eat a lit Christingle...

[laughter]

people have something to say about it.

[applause]

"Can you just blow the candle out,
please, sir?"

"Uh, the candle's got to be lit,

otherwise I can't see what I'm doing
when I'm peeling the orange.

[laughter]

So complain to Jesus, not me. Ignorant."

[laughter]

Side note, if I'm ever in a food fight,

-Christingle, weapon of choice.
-[laughter]

There's a lot going on there,
spikes and fire.

Best of luck with your custard pie.

[laughter]

That Christingle service was beautiful.

The whole jury went to it.

We sat at the side of the church
in two rows of six. Force of habit.

[laughter]

It felt weird being there actually.

When I was a little kid,

I used to go to those
Christingle services all the time.

It brought all those feelings back
of being a little Christian boy.

So much doubt.

All the time. I'd go to bed every night,
I'd turn the light off.

"No more jobs!" I'd shout "no more jobs."

[laughter]

I didn't really have jobs back then.
I was just copying my dad.

[laughter]

And I'd stare at the ceiling,
and I'd think,

"What came before the Big Bang?

What came before God?

What came before that?
What came before that?

What came before that?"

I'd think about what came
before that every night.

And as I left the church that day
as an adult...

I felt like that little
Christian boy again.

All doubtful.

I'm not proud of this,
but in the days following,

I lost my swagger.

[scattered laughter]

Went out the window.

In court, every day, the jury
go away in a little room

and debate the case. Just the jury.

Suddenly, everyone else
had an opinion except for me.

They were all saying stuff like,
"There's no way he's innocent."

And, "All the evidence points to him."

And, "So many twists and turns,

there's no way your friends
won't get wet."

And we were like, "Hugh...

[laughter]

stop hyping the log flume
for two seconds.

[applause]

It's a double murder case.
Get your head in the game.

There's a time and a place, Hugh.
They can hear you outside."

[scattered laughter]

I just started playing
Devil's advocate in those debates.

That's what you do if you don't have
an opinion anymore.

'Cause Devil's advocate,
you don't need an opinion.

You just say the opposite
to what everyone else is saying.

It's not on you, it's not you...

-it's the devil.
-[laughter]

Who, let's not forget,
is a certified rotter.

[laughter]

In my books.

I've played Devil's advocate
from the get-go.

Day one, first debate
we ever had as a jury,

everyone else on the jury,
they were saying that the murder

was really bad.

[laughter]

Prime opportunity... for a little DA.

[laughter]

I piped up, I was like,
"Hey, guys, to be fair,

we're all gonna die one day anyway.

These people just died a little earlier
than they would have in the first place.

Cut this guy some slack. Let him walk."

[laughter]

Back to my hotel, I rang my mom.

I was like, "Hey, Mom,
I played Devil's advocate in court today.

You'd have been proud of me.
I looked real clever."

She said,
"Did you lead up to it by saying,

-'Just playing Devil's advocate'"?
-[laughter]

"Should I have?"
She went, "Undoubtedly.

Otherwise it just sounds like
your own horrific opinion."

[laughter]

Day two involved a lot of back-peddling.

[laughter]

Had a similar problem
with "no pun intended."

Couple of days later,
we're having a debate.

I piped up, I was like,
"Hey, guys, no pun intended,

but do you think it's possible
that the gardener

planted evidence?"

[laughter]

Back to my hotel, rang my mom.

I was like, "Hey, Mom,
I said 'no pun intended' in court today.

You'd have been proud of me.
I looked real clever."

She said, "Did you say 'no pun intended'

at the end of the sentence?"

[laughter]

"I said it at the top."
She went, "Right.

That does sound like you knew
fully well you were headed into a pun...

[laughter]

and did very little to change course.

Therefore the pun
was fully intended, James."

What I learnt from those two experiences

is if you make a pun
in polite conversation,

people will hate you...

more than that time
you openly defended murder.

[laughter]

Play Devil's advocate all you want,
doesn't help you any.

Still didn't know
what way I was gonna vote.

I remember the day of the verdict,

I was sitting there
in the dentist's waiting room.

[scattered laughter]

I was tense, you know, I felt edgy.

I had to decide if someone went to prison
for the rest of their life later that day.

No, thank you. I felt sick.

At one point, the receptionist came over,

handed me a questionnaire to fill out.

Said, "Fill that out while you're waiting.
Everyone's filling them out."

I thought, "Actually,
this might be just the ticket.

Right now,
I'm having a crisis of certainty.

I could bang through this questionnaire,
get all the questions right,

reclaim my swagger, take it into court."

With that in mind, question one,
probably the last thing I needed.

Question one on a dental questionnaire...

"On a scale of one to ten,

how happy are you...

with your smile?"

[scattered laughter]

How happy are you...

with your smile?

With your smile?

-On a scale of one to ten,
-[laughter]

How happy are you--? Happy.

How happy are you...

with your smile? With your--?

-On a scale of one to ten...
-[laughter]

how happy are you...?

Happy. How happy are you...

with your smile?

With your--? With your smile?

On a scale of one to ten... how happy--?

You know that thing that you do
when you're happy?

[scattered laughter]

How happy are you with that?

"You feeling happy?" "Yep, sure am."

"You smiling?" "Yep."

"How's that make you feel?" "What?

[laughter]

Sad. I think I feel sad now.

I was feeling happy, then you went,
'Stop, analyze it. How do you look?'

Stupid. I look stupid.
I probably won't bother again."

How happy are you with your happiness
essentially, isn't it?

With your happiness.

That's not a dental question,
that's an existential question.

What's question two?
"What came before that?"

[laughter]

Scale of one to ten-- And by the way,

I'm sitting there
in the dentist's waiting room,

there's a poster on the wall
of a cartoon tooth,

and the tooth had a face,
and the tooth was smiling,

-and the tooth had teeth.
-[laughter]

Like something out of a horror film.
There were kids in there.

On a scale of one to ten--
One to ten!

One to ten-- I don't know what any
of those numbers represent by the way.

One to ten, you figure it out.

That's how all of you feel, is one to ten.

I'm assuming one is the depths
of human despair...

[laughter]

and ten is staying up past midnight.

Everything in between it,
your guess is as good as mine.

Do the tooth teeth have teeth, too?

[laughter]

Do the tooth teeth have teeth, too?

[applause]

I'm already happy.

That's why I'm smiling.

I feel happy and then I smile.
I don't smile and then feel happy.

I don't know who's doing it
that way round,

checking what their face is doing
and then copying it.

[laughter]

I feel happy and then I smile.

And maybe I'll see that smile,
feel a bit happier.

Maybe. But it's not its own thing, is it?

It's not its own thing. It's standing on
the shoulders of that original happiness

that made you smile in the first place.
It's a top-up. At best it's a top-up.

Right. Say-- Say-- You feel happy, right?
You feel happy,

and then you get to an eight. Poof.

And then you smile.
You smile at an eight.

Then maybe you see that smile,
feel a bit happier. Poof.

Ten.

That's not how happy you are
with your smile, is it? You know it's not.

You've got to subtract
that original eight,

'cause that's the happiness
that made you smile in the first--

Do you even know what
I'm talking about right now?

[laughter]

You can't hand it all in. That's not
how happy you are with your smile,

that's how happy you are with your smile

plus seeing the dogs get into a fridge,

or whatever it was
that made your day so much.

You've got to subtract that eight.

Two. Two.

What's that, verging on hopelessness
with your smile?

You had an eight a minute ago,
you've got a two now, mate.

And two is the highest you get
from an eight as well.

Highest from an eight is a two,
highest from a nine, one,

highest from a ten, zero.

The happier you are,

the sadder you end up.

[laughter]

It's what I learnt...

at the dentist.

[laughter]

I'm not filling that out.

I've been there for ten minutes,
I've written nothing.

I've written my name and a lot
of workings out in the margins.

[laughter]

I thought, "I can't fill it out.
Fuck it, I'm not filling it out."

Left it, just walked away.
Didn't even stay for my appointment.

The receptionist shouted my name after me.
Not gonna work.

Shout your own name out, I'll turn around.

-I'm not turning around for my name.
-[laughter]

[microphone thuds]

[laughter]

[laughter]

[laughter]

[scattered laughter]

It was a hung jury. It was a hung jury.

[laughter]

[laughter]

There you go.

There's an hour of your life
you're not getting back.

[laughter]

[applause]

I'm sorry. It's disappointing,
I know it's disappointing.

Everyone hates a hung jury.

Even the other jurors hate you.

Remember Lucas?

He was furious. He's standing there,
ranting in his bandanna.

[laughter]

Having a go at all of us,
"That's bullshit.

That guy's definitely guilty.
You guys are a bunch of pussies."

"Shut up, man.

We can't all be geese like you.
I wish I was a goose.

[scattered laughter]

But I'm not. I'm jealous of you.

I'm jealous of all of you.
I'm jealous of you,

I'm jealous of him for believing
in something that I gave up on.

When you're a little Christian boy,
everything's nice.

It's exactly where it should be
and it makes sense.

When you grow up, it should get easier,

but it gets harder, you get more scared
and more doubtful,

and then you end up just
moving everything around,

taking it apart,
and throwing a giant strop.

[laughter]

I used to believe stuff.

The only thing I believe these days...

is celebrity gossip.

[laughter]

You know, um...

Mario Gomez...

[laughter]

he often sends people e-mails
with the subject heading:

'check out this funny video,'

then forgets to include the link.

[laughter]

I like Chilean miners.
I watched it on the news.

I know for a fact that all of it happened,
and it had a happy ending.

I like that. I don't like any of this.
This is shit."

[laughter]

I remember he looked at me...

said...

"Listen, Wolf, don't compare yourself
to the rest of us.

[laughter]

It's stupid. Listen, you want to know
what I think about you, honestly?

If anything, I'm jealous of you.

You're the only person
on this whole jury...

who got to go on a log flume."

[laughter]

"Twice.

[laughter]

It was a fun day.

Hold on, I...

I never told anyone...

what I got for Secret Santa."

[scattered laughter]
